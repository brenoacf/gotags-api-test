# gotags-api-test
Development of an API for storing values ​​in a bank using GO for studies.

In this project, I use Golang with Go-Gin for the routes, GORM as ORM for the connection to a local SQLite database and Swaggo to generate the Swagger documentation.

In addition, I use a makefile to run the application.

This project was based on a video by Arthur 404 dev on YouTube, where he explains how to create a simple API with Golang.

This project served as an initial study for using this language.

## To run the project using the Makefile, do:

```bash
$ make
```

## To run directly, from the main directory, do:

```bash
go run main.go
```
